        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>Extra butter and maple syrup for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In
            a separate bowl, beat together the milk, egg, and melted butter. Stir in the
            lemon zest and lemon juice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet
            ingredients. Stir just until combined. The batter will be slightly lumpy.
            Gently fold in the blueberries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or
            scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each
            pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.</li>
